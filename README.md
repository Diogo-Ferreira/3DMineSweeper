# 3DMineSweeper
A 3D Minesweeper game written in Java with JMonkeyEngine. This was my CFC final project at CEFF Industrie school back in 2014.

Here is some documentation (Only in french, sorry) : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9rxAiua5lIZVkhpTDY5d28xMWc/view?usp=sharing 

*Basically the game is the same as always, but you have a "rubik's" instead of a 2D game board*

# Features
* Size selection (Max 12 cube in one axe)
* You can mark a cube with right click
* With C-Key you can show some cages around the numbers
* Zoome with the mouse wheel


# How to run it ?
* lauch the MineSweeper3D.jar file in the dist folder
* Of course, you must have java installed
